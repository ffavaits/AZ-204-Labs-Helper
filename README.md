# AZ-204 Labs Helper

This repository is a helper for the instructors and attendees of the AZ-204 course.
It aims to minimize the time to create the full labs.

## Use scenarios
- A trainer wants to have the lab resources to be able to explain the lab or troubleshoot
- A student wants to skip the instructions and see the lab solution.

## How to use
There are two ways to use deploy a lab environment:
- Clone this repo either to CloudShell (recommended) or to your local machine, then run the PS script in the folder of the lab environment you want to deploy
- OR, in GitHub, navigate to the folder of the lab environment you want to deploy and click the deploy button.
